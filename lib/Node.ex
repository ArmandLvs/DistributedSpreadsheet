  ### Private Functions

  @doc """
  ReplicateLog is a helper function that synchronizes the log of the leader with a follower.
  The simplest way to synchronize the log is to send the entire log to the follower. However, this is inefficient.
  As mentioned earlier, the leader assumes that the log of the follower is the same as its own log when it becomes a leader.
  Therefore, the leader only needs to send the log entries that the follower does not have.

sentLength[follower] := log.length // the node assumes that the log of the follower is the same as its own log

The leader maintains a variable sentLength for each follower. sentLength[follower] denotes the length of the log that the leader believes the follower has.
When the leader synchronizes the logs with the follower, it will send the log entries after sentLength[follower].
If the synchronization is failed, the leader will decrease sentLength[follower] by 1, and try again.
